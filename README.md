## A Little About Me
My name is Charles and I am currently working as a cloud security engineer at IX Cloud Security. I have an M.S. in robotics from the University of Pennsylvania and a B.S. in mechanical engineering from Villanova University. Some technologies I work with regularly with are: AWS, Terraform, Python, and Shell. I am particularly interested in machine learning and am currently exploring how it can be used to enhance cybersecurity of cloud infrastructures. If you would like to contact me, you can reach me at:

## My Most Recent Project
My most recent project is a data lake reference architecture that I developed as part of my work at IX Cloud Security. For this project, I provisioned multiple Lambda functions in AWS using Terraform to scrape and store data to S3. The data is then presented in a secure manner using a CloudFront distribution.
