# Welcome to My Profile! 👋
## 😀 A Little About Me
Hi, I’m Charles, a Cloud Security Engineer at IX Cloud Security. I manage client cloud infrastructures, which includes managing access control, monitoring security events, and automating workflows to keep environments secure and efficient. I work regularly with AWS, Terraform, Python, and Shell. I’m also particularly interested in Generative AI, exploring how it can be used safely and how it can be applied to enhance applications such as cybersecurity.

## 🚀 My Recent Projects
For my most recent project, I created a FastAPI backend that generates follow-up questions for interviewers based on an original question and a candidate’s response. The service exposes a POST endpoint that accepts the interview question, the candidate’s answer, and optional metadata such as job role or interview stage, helping interviewers get contextually relevant prompts to make the interview process more effective. The backend and tests are fully implemented, and the project is ready to use. [You can check out my work for this project by clicking here.](https://github.com/cyoo28/genai-interview-followup)

For another project, I created a generative AI chatbot application. I developed 2 versions of this chatbot: one that can be run in AWS and use the Bedrock API as well as one that can run in GCP and use the Google GenerativeAI API. This serves as part of my work for IX Cloud Security to develop a chatbot that can help facilitate knowledge transfer. For privacy reasons, that version of the chatbot is unavailable.  [However, you can check a more basic version of my work here.](https://github.com/cyoo28/genai-demo) This version is not tailored towards any specific usecase and does not contain any special tooling. I will be writing a tutorial to help users develop their own generative AI powered applications.

I am also currently writing a couple tutorial series for how to use Kubernetes. One tutorial covers how to set up a self-managed cluster, helping users get familiar with managing Kubernetes. Another tutorial explains how to set up a production-level EKS cluster in AWS, showing users how to create a practical deployment of Kubernetes. I am in the middle of writing these tutorials, and once they are published, I will update this page with links to the articles.
