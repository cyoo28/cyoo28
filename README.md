# Welcome to My Profile! 👋
## 😀 A Little About Me
My name is Charles and I am currently working as a cloud security engineer at IX Cloud Security. I have an M.S. in robotics from the University of Pennsylvania and a B.S. in mechanical engineering from Villanova University. Some technologies I work with regularly with are: AWS, Terraform, Python, and Shell. I am particularly interested in machine learning and am currently exploring how it can be used to enhance cybersecurity of cloud infrastructures. If you would like to contact me, you can reach me at:

## 🚀 My Recent Projects
For my most recent project, I am currently creating tutorials for how to use Kubernetes. One tutorial will go over how to set up a self-managed cluster, to help familiarize users with how to set up and manage Kubernetes. The other tutorial will go over how to set up a production-level EKS cluster in AWS. This will help users understand how to create a practical deployment of Kubernetes. I am in the middle of writing these tutorials but once they are published, I will update this page with the link to the articles.

For another project, I created a generative AI chatbot application. I developed 2 versions of this chatbot: one that can be run in AWS and use the Bedrock API as well as one that can run in GCP and use the Google GenerativeAI API. This serves as part of my work for IX Cloud Security to develop a chatbot that can help facilitate knowledge transfer. For privacy reasons, that version of the chatbot is unavailable.  [However, you can check a more basic version of my work here.](https://github.com/cyoo28/genai-demo) This version is not tailored towards any specific usecase and does not contain any special tooling. Once I am finished writing my tutorials on Kubernetes, I will also be writing a tutorial to help users develop their own generative AI powered applications.

For a slightly older project (but still recent), I created a credential manager as part of my work at IX Cloud Security. For this project, I run a scheduled ECS task to rotate old secrets in GCP and to notify the SecOps team about which secrets have been changed.
